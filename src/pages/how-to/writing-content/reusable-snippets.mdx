# Reusable Snippets

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This is a principle that we should apply to our documentation as well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating and using a custom snippet

1. Create a new file in the `_snippets` directory.
2. Construct your snippet content - it can be a component or a chunk of text.

```md _snippets/my-snippet.mdx
## My Snippet

This is my snippet.
```

3. Navigate to the file where you want to use the snippet.
4. Add the snippet to the file using the following syntax:

import MySnippet from '@/_snippets/my-snippet.mdx'

<MySnippet />

```md destination-file.mdx
import MySnippet from '@/_snippets/my-snippet.mdx'

<MySnippet />
```
